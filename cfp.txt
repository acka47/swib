Subject: [CfP] SWIB20 - 12th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference, Bonn, 23-25 November

Call for Proposals: SWIB20 - 12th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference
23.11. - 25.11.2020, Bonn, Germany

Submission Deadline: 12 May 2020


+++What about Corona?+++

As the ongoing Corona pandemic is a big issue for every conference organizazion, we are addressing it at the beginning of this call.

 SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference, being held for the 12th time. Until now, each rendition of SWIB has taken place as a classical conference with participants appearing in-person at the venue and engaging in workshops and conference talks. With the ongoing Corona pandemic and the accompanying uncertainties with regard to the freedoms of movement and assembly, we can not rely on carrying out the conference as usual. We will take these uncertainties into account in the best possible way so that everyone with an interest in SWIB will be able to present and listen to presentations and deepen their skills in hands-on workshops.

 For now, we will continue planning for a physical conference in Bonn to be flanked by opportunities of online participation for all those who may not be able to attend. In addition, we will prepare for a cancellation of the physical event by looking into possible online formats.

++++++

SWIB focuses on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations. It is well established as an event where IT staff, developers, librarians, and researchers from over the world meet and mingle and learn from each other. The topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking data and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas of focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas.

As usual, SWIB20 will be organized by the ZBW - German National Library of Economics / Leibniz Information Centre for Economics and the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz). The conference language is English.

Would you like to share your experiences working on an interesting service, research topic or project – not just what you did, but also how you did it? Would you like to offer a hands-on pre-conference tutorial or workshop on the afternoon of November 23?
