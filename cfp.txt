Call for Proposals: SWIB16 - Semantic Web in Libraries Conference
28.11. - 30.11.2016, Bonn, Germany

The SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference focusing on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations. It is held in Germany, by turns in the Cologne region and Hamburg. The topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking data and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas of focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas. SWIB mainly targets IT staff, developers, librarians and researchers.

As in prior years, SWIB16 will be organized by the ZBW - German National Library of Economics / Leibniz Information Centre for Economics and the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz). The conference language is English.

Is there an interesting service, research topic or project that you would like to present at the conference? Would you like to offer a pre-conference tutorial or workshop on the afternoon of 28 November?
